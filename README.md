Dichotomous Key for Unknown Bacteria
Hello! This dichotomous key was designed for determining which Gram positive bacteria was given to a student out of 16 possible choices. This key can be used while working in the lab (it will prompt the user to perform particular lab tests based on previous results) or it can be used after a suite of lab tests have been completed and results have been recorded.

This key was created in the style of a "choose your own adventure" decision tree. Simply start the program and then answer the prompts according to your lab results. 

Here are the list of possible bacteria: 
(1) Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis 
(2) Mycobacterium phlei 
(3) Listeria monocytogenes 
(4) Corynebacterium diptheria 
(5) Bacillus cercus 
(6) Bacillus subtillis 
(7) Clostridium perfringens 
(8) Clostridium sporogenes 
(9) Staphylococcus aureus 
(10) Staphylococcus saprophyticus 
(11) Micrococcus luteus 
(12) Staphylococcus epidermidis 
(13) Streptococcus pyogenes 
(14) Enterococcus faecalis 
(15) Streptococcus pneumoniae 
(16) Streptococcus agalactiae
