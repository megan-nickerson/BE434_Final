Dichotomous Key for Unknown Bacteria
Hello! This dichotomous key was designed for determining which Gram positive bacteria was given to a student out of 16 possible choices. This key can be used while working in the lab (it will prompt the user to perform particular lab tests based on previous results) or it can be used after a suite of lab tests have been completed and results have been recorded.

This key was created in the style of a "choose your own adventure" decision tree. Simply start the program, and then answer the prompts according to your lab results. 

Here are the list of bacteria:
Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis
Mycobacterium phlei
Listeria monocytogenes
Corynebacterium diptheria
Bacillus cercus
Bacillus subtillis
Clostridium perfringens
Clostridium sporogenes
Staphylococcus aureus
Staphylococcus saprophyticus
Micrococcus luteus
Staphylococcus epidermidis
Streptococcus pyogenes
Enterococcus faecalis
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Streptococcus agalactiae
